## Play-by-play:

Let me do, and I will tell you as I go along -- I don't plan.

I see I have the scooper dooper.

What is there to type already?

I guess I'll use the fork to measure the baking powder. (a teaspon)

When I say sugar I mean brown sugar. White sugar is stupid. In St Lucia when you say sugar you mean brown sugar.
When you say white sugar you mean white people sugar.

Do I normally add sugar? I don't think I normally add sugar.

I don't like you watching me. This not coming out good. Are you writing that down? Why?



## Yield:
6 4in Pancakes

## Instructions
#### Mix together dry ingredients (in a measuring cup):
        1/2 cup flower
        another 2/3rds of a half flax seeds
        1 scoop of protein powder, should be just about a cup of ingredients total at this point
        1 tsp baking powder
        oooh cinammon 1/2 tsp
        (optional) maybe some brown sugar 1 tbsp
      mix the ingredients up
      tip: you can pre-make and store the mixture, then you just add water or egg next time.
        
#### In a separate (wet) bowl:
        break 2 eggs (make sure the eggs don't have shell)
          (optional) Remove the germ of the egg (the baby chicken)
        1 tsp vanilla essence (or you can get vanilla beans)
      mix these up.
      
#### Turn on the stove to 5-6/10 to pre-heat your 4-6inch pan.

#### Combine: pour the wet on top of the dry and mix well.
    If it's not mixing, add a little bit of water (or milk), and then mix.
    Repeat adding water & mixing until the mixture is runny.

    Consistency test: If you take your fork out, roughly 50% of the mixture on the fork
    should fall back into the measuring cup with 3-5 seconds.

    If more than 50% of the mixture falls off, add flower to make your mix
    less watery. If less than 50% of the mixture falls off add water.
       
       
#### Cook
    reduce heat to 3-4/10
    for each pancake repeate:
        melt 1/4 tbsp butter
        pour about 1/4 cup little into the center of the pan, it will expand to fill the pan
        put chocolate chips, as many as you want, arrange however you want, e.g. a smiley face.

        cook for about 3 minutes per side , turning once. (6 minutes per pancake total)
